# Responsive infographic

## Overview

Create a fully responsive & interactive infographic using Javascript, transitions, animations & SVG.

- *Fork this repository.*
- Use lots of lovely Javascript to add interactivity.
- Add transitions, animations and SVG fanciness.
- **Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.**

### Work from something that exists

If you’ve previously created an infographic, maybe in David Bromley’s class, you’re welcome to code that.

You could also look at recreating a static image-based infographic you’ve found online if you give the original designer credit.

## Markbot will expect…

- Valid HTML following best practices.
- Valid CSS following best practices.
- Valid JS following best practices.
- `css/main.css`, `js/main.js` & `jquery` is linked.
